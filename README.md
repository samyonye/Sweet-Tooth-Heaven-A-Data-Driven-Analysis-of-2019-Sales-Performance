Data analysis dashboard for fictional cookie brand using excel
In the world of data, insights are the real treats — and this dashboard delivers a full box of them. I recently built an interactive analytics dashboard to explore the 2019 performance of Sweet Tooth Heaven, a fictional cookie brand. The goal was to transform raw sales data into a compelling visual story that could inform product strategy, marketing, and geographic expansion decisions.

Key Insights
Chocolate Chip is the top performer — leading in revenue, profit, and units sold.

India is the best-performing country, with the highest overall revenue and profit.

July recorded peak revenue, making it a potential focus for future promotional efforts.

Chocolate Chip also has the highest production cost, yet still remains the most profitable.

Unit sales align strongly with product profitability — evidence of strong consumer demand.
